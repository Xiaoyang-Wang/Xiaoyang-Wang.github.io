## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src=".jpg"> -->

I'm currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign. Before I came to this amazing corn field, I was a Master student in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University, worked with Profs. Peter Dinda and Gokhan Memik. I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Central South University.

## Research Interest

I broadly interested in computer systems.
